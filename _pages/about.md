\*\*NOTE: This website is still in the process of completion. I hope you enjoy what is here!

My name is Erica Huang, and I am currently a junior at Tufts University (during the summer of 2026 I will be transitioning into my senior year). I am majoring in Computer Science within the School of Engineering, and minoring in Embedded Systems. I am passionate about all things STEM, including robotics, artificial intelligence, human-robot interaction, systems design, and the ethical applications of technology. [See my resume HERE](/cv/) for more information.

When I'm not programming or tinkering around with devices, you can find me on the basketball court, reading in my hammock, on the slopes snowboarding, finding ramen places around Boston, or casually racing my dad in our daily [Slitherlink](https://www.brainbashers.com/slitherlink.asp) matchups. If you want to learn more about my hobbies and what makes me me besides my academic passions, click [HERE](/hobbies/).
